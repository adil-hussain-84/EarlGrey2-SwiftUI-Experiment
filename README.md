# About

This Xcode project experiments with using EarlGrey 2 to test a SwiftUI application. It has been built by following the EarlGrey 2 [setup guide](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/blob/earlgrey2/docs/setup.md). It adds EarlGrey 2 to an iOS UI Testing Bundle.

Note that this project assumes that the `EarlGrey` folder which contains the `EarlGrey.xcodeproj` file exists at the same level as the folder which contains this project's `EarlGrey2Experiment.xcodeproj` file. So if the `EarlGrey2Experiment.xcodeproj` file is located in the `Repositories/EarlGrey2Experiment` folder, then the `EarlGrey.xcodeproj` file is to be located in the `Repositories/EarlGrey` folder.
